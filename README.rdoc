== Set up

This project demonstrates a number of components using React Animations, with the React CSS Transition Group and React Motion.

# Clone the git project
# Run `bundle install` and `npm install`
# Run `rails s` to start the server

Please don't judge me on the lack of test and terrible CSS ...!
